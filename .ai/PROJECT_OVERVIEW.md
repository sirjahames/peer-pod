# PeerPod - Project Overview

## What is PeerPod?

PeerPod is a **freelance team formation platform** that matches freelancers into compatible teams for client projects. Unlike traditional freelance platforms that focus solely on skills, PeerPod uses **AI-powered compatibility analysis** based on:

- **Personality traits** (Big Five model)
- **Work style preferences** (deadlines, communication, collaboration)
- **Scheduling compatibility** (availability, time zones, response times)
- **Skills alignment** (technical proficiency matching)

## Problem Statement

Freelance teams often struggle with:
- Personality clashes and communication issues
- Misaligned work styles (deadline approaches, quality expectations)

## Solution

1. **Comprehensive onboarding quiz** - Captures personality, work style, and availability
